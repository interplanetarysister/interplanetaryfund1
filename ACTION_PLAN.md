## Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Backend Foundation (Convex)
*Must be done before frontend can function*

1. *Schema — userProfiles table* ✅ DONE
   - Fields: userId, name, email, subscriptionTier, adminAccessStatus, timestamps
   - Index: byUserId, byEmail

2. *Schema — userCampaigns table* ✅ DONE
   - Fields: userId, title, summary, story, category, goalAmount, raisedAmount, donorCount, status, coverImageUrl, endDate, location, cashappTag, outreachEnabled, timestamps
   - Index: byUserId, byStatus
   - Ownership enforced in all mutations

3. *Backend — userAuth.ts* ✅ DONE
   - register(email, name) → creates userProfile, returns userId
   - login(email) → passwordless, returns userId + profile data
   - getProfile(userId) → returns user profile

4. *Backend — userCampaigns.ts* ✅ DONE
   - getMyCampaigns(userId) → campaigns owned by user
   - getActiveCampaigns() → public list for explore page
   - getCampaign(campaignId) → single campaign (public view)
   - createCampaign(userId, ...) → creates with ownership
   - updateCampaign(campaignId, userId, ...) → ownership enforced
   - deleteCampaign(campaignId, userId) → ownership enforced
   - recordDonation(campaignId, amount, donorName, message) → updates raised amount

5. *Backend — campaignUpdates table* ✅ DONE
   - addCampaignUpdate, getCampaignUpdates

6. *Backend — followedCampaigns table* ✅ DONE
   - followCampaign, unfollowCampaign, getFollowedCampaigns

7. *Backend — notifications table* ✅ DONE
   - getNotifications, markNotificationRead

8. *Backend — donations table* ✅ DONE
   - Linked to userCampaigns via campaignId

### Phase 2: Frontend — Core User Flow (React/Vite)
*Depends on Phase 1 backend being deployed*

9. *UserLogin.tsx* ✅ DONE
   - Login/register with email
   - Passwordless (email-based)
   - Calls userAuth.register and userAuth.login

10. *UserDashboard.tsx* ✅ DONE
    - My Campaigns tab (create, view, edit)
    - Following tab
    - Notifications tab
    - Create campaign form inline

11. *CampaignEditor.tsx* ✅ DONE
    - Edit all campaign fields
    - Ownership check (non-owners can only view)
    - Campaign updates section (add posts)
    - Donation recording

12. *Campaign Detail Page* ✅ DONE
    - Public view of campaign (non-owners)
    - Story display with formatting
    - Donation flow (PayPal/CashApp integration)
    - Progress bar (raised vs goal)
    - Campaign updates feed
    - Follow button

13. *Explore.tsx — Update to use userCampaigns* ✅ DONE
    - Currently reads from monitoredCampaigns (admin mirror)
    - Should display userCampaigns (user-created campaigns)
    - Keep monitoredCampaigns for admin cockpit only
    - Show campaign cards with: title, summary, progress, category filter

14. *App.tsx — Wire user flow* ✅ DONE
    - Auth state management (localStorage userId)
    - Route: not logged in → UserLogin
    - Route: logged in → UserDashboard (default)
    - Route: edit campaign → CampaignEditor
    - Route: explore → Explore (public)
    - Route: campaign detail → CampaignDetail
    - Admin route stays as-is (PIN-gated)

### Phase 3: Payment Integration
*Depends on Phase 2 frontend*

15. *Donation flow on campaign detail page* ✅ DONE
    - Amount selector + custom amount
    - PayPal checkout (existing paypalCheckout.ts)
    - CashApp link (existing cashappTag field)
    - On success: call recordDonation mutation
    - Update campaign raisedAmount in real-time

16. *Payout/withdrawal flow* ✅ DONE
    - User requests payout from dashboard
    - Platform fee deduction (existing treasury.ts)
    - Admin approval in cockpit

### Phase 4: Platform Growth Features
*Can be done in parallel after Phase 3*

## Facebook Agent Behavior Rules

1. Proactively join groups — even when no active campaigns exist
2. Silent membership is OK
3. Never post test campaigns to groups
4. Always awaiting new campaign data input
5. When idle — improve post syntax for donation-evoking language

---

## Vercel Deployment Setup (Pending)

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link project: `vercel link` (select interplanetarysister/InterplanetaryFund)
3. Set env vars: `VITE_CONVEX_URL=https://rosy-butterfly-2.convex.cloud`
4. Deploy: `vercel --prod`
5. Update GitHub Actions to deploy to Vercel instead of Pages (optional — can keep both)

## CI/CD Pipeline

| Workflow | Trigger | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Deploy to Convex | Push to main | ✅ Passing |
| Deploy to GitHub Pages | Push to main | ✅ Passing |
| Vercel auto-deploy | ✅ Active | Auto-deploys on push to main |
