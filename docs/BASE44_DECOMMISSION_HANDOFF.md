**Date:** 2026-08-07
**Authority:** Solene, Chief of Staff for Agents

## Starting Commit
$STARTING_COMMIT

## Changes Completed
1. Created native Convex replacement for midnightAccountReport (convex/midnightAccountReport.ts) using Resend API instead of Base44 Gmail OAuth
2. Added Convex cron job for daily account report at 07:00 UTC (midnight PT)
3. Updated .github/copilot-instructions.md — Base44 is now LEGACY, Convex is canonical
4. Updated ARCHITECTURE.md — Mobile section now references Capacitor, not Base44
5. Updated MOBILE_BUILD.md — Base44 APK method labeled LEGACY/DEPRECATED
6. Updated MOBILE_ROADMAP.md — Base44 reference replaced with Capacitor
7. Removed docs/platform_accounts.csv (plaintext credentials — see Security below)
8. Added docs/platform_accounts.csv to .gitignore
9. Deleted all obsolete Base44 runtime code (see Files Deleted)
10. Deleted functions/taskRelay.ts (Base44 SDK dependency, used Base44 TaskRelay entity)
11. Ran Convex codegen to generate updated TypeScript bindings
12. Verified production build passes (6.36s, 0 errors)
13. Verified TypeScript compilation passes (0 errors)

## Files Deleted
1. base44-functions/enforceCampaignProtocol.ts — Convex protocol.ts + protocolAutoFix.ts supersedes
2. base44-functions/treasuryManager.ts — Convex treasury.ts supersedes
3. base44-functions/weeklyTrainingSync.ts — Convex protocol.weeklyTraining supersedes
4. base44-functions/syncConvexData.ts — Obsolete, Convex is source of truth
5. base44-functions/midnightAccountReport/entry.ts — Replaced by convex/midnightAccountReport.ts
6. base44-sync/syncConvexData.ts — Obsolete sync, Convex is canonical
7. base44/agents/your_agent.jsonc — Historical agent config
8. base44/entities/User.jsonc — Historical entity schema
9. functions/taskRelay.ts — Replaced by convex/taskRelay.ts (native Convex implementation with taskRelay table in schema)
10. docs/platform_accounts.csv — Plaintext credentials, security risk

## Files Modified
1. convex/midnightAccountReport.ts — NEW: Native Convex replacement (Resend API)
2. convex/crons.ts — Added midnight-account-report cron (07:00 UTC daily)
3. .github/copilot-instructions.md — Updated architecture to Convex canonical
4. ARCHITECTURE.md — Updated mobile section to Capacitor
5. MOBILE_BUILD.md — Base44 APK labeled LEGACY/DEPRECATED
6. MOBILE_ROADMAP.md — Replaced Base44 reference with Capacitor
7. .gitignore — Added docs/platform_accounts.csv
8. convex/taskRelay.ts — NEW: Native Convex replacement for Base44 taskRelay function
9. convex/schema.ts — Added taskRelay table with bySprintId index

## Files Intentionally Retained
1. base44-app-schema.json — Historical migration artifact documenting 31 Base44 entity schemas. Retained for reference and potential data migration needs.
2. fundforge/ directory — Reference architecture from fundforge-ai. Contains Base44 SDK references but is NOT part of the production build (not imported by src/ or convex/). Retained as reference only.
3. docs/SOLENE_TRANSITION.md — Historical transition documentation
4. docs/CREDIT_FREE_AGENT_PROTOCOL.md — Contains portability notes mentioning Base44
5. legal/APP_IP_PROTECTION.md — Legal document referencing Base44 app IDs (do not modify)
6. docs/AGENT_DISCOVERY.md — Historical record of Base44 app inventory

## Base44 Runtime Dependencies
ZERO — No production code imports or calls Base44 SDK. All Base44 functions deleted. Convex handles all runtime operations.

## Base44 Build/Deployment Dependencies
ZERO — package.json has no Base44 dependency. Vite, Vercel, Capacitor configs have no Base44 references. CI/CD workflows do not call Base44.

## Base44 Configuration Dependencies
ZERO — .env.example references only Convex, Browserbase, Resend, and Stripe. No Base44 environment variables.

## Resend Replacement
IMPLEMENTED — convex/midnightAccountReport.ts uses Resend API for email delivery. Cron scheduled at 07:00 UTC daily. RESEND_API_KEY must be set as a Convex environment variable. Until configured, the function logs reports to the notifications table instead of sending email.

## Convex Canonical Backend
CONFIRMED — Convex (rosy-butterfly-2.convex.cloud) is the canonical source of truth for all data: campaigns, users, donations, treasury, agents, protocol, payments, notifications, scheduled jobs (16 cron jobs now).

## Security Findings
docs/platform_accounts.csv was removed. It contained plaintext credentials (email/password) for 11 external crowdfunding platform accounts. No application code referenced this file. The file exists in Git history (since commit fe4ced5).

### Credential Rotation Required
The following platform account categories had credentials exposed in Git history and should be rotated:
1. GoFundMe
2. Kickstarter
3. Indiegogo
4. Patreon
5. BuyMeACoffee
6. Ko-fi
7. GiveSendGo
8. FundRazr
9. Spotfund
10. Bluesky
11. Facebook

Credentials have NOT been rotated — I do not have authorization or ability to rotate them.

## Tests Executed
1. npm run build — PASS (6.36s, 0 errors)
2. npx tsc --noEmit — PASS (0 errors)
3. npx convex codegen — PASS (TypeScript bindings generated)
4. Final Base44 search — PASS (0 runtime, 0 build, 0 config dependencies)

## Tests Not Executable
1. Convex deployment — NOT EXECUTED — requires `npx convex deploy` with Convex CLI auth
2. Vercel deployment — NOT EXECUTED — requires Vercel CLI auth
3. Capacitor sync — NOT EXECUTED — no android/ directory initialized
4. Android build — NOT EXECUTED — no Android SDK
5. iOS build — NOT LOCALLY BUILD-VERIFIABLE — no Xcode/macOS
6. Runtime flow tests — NOT EXECUTED — environment limitation
7. Resend email delivery — NOT EXECUTED — RESEND_API_KEY not configured

## Remaining Manual Actions
1. Set RESEND_API_KEY as Convex environment variable: `npx convex env set RESEND_API_KEY <key>`
2. Deploy Convex functions: `npx convex deploy`
3. Deploy to Vercel: `vercel --prod` (or push to main for auto-deploy)
4. Rotate credentials for 11 external platform accounts (see Security Findings)
5. Verify Git history does not expose credentials (consider BFG repo cleaner or credential rotation)
6. Initialize Capacitor Android project: `npx cap add android` (when ready for mobile build)
7. Verify no Base44 workflows are actively triggering (check Base44 dashboard)
8. After independent review: shut down Base44 app, revoke OAuth connections

## Remaining Risks
1. Git history contains plaintext credentials in docs/platform_accounts.csv (removed from HEAD but still in history)
2. Base44 may still have active scheduled jobs or workflows that reference deleted functions — verify in Base44 dashboard before final shutdown
3. fundforge/ directory contains Base44 SDK references but is NOT part of production build — low risk
4. RESEND_API_KEY not yet configured — daily account report will log to notifications but not send email until configured
5. Convex codegen ran successfully but functions are not yet deployed to production

## Final Status

READY FOR FINAL BASE44 SHUTDOWN

The GitHub repository operates independently on:
React/Vite → Vercel → Convex → Capacitor → Android/iOS

Zero production Base44 runtime dependencies remain.
All obsolete Base44 code has been removed.
Native Convex replacement implemented for the last Base44-only function.
Production build and TypeScript compilation pass.
