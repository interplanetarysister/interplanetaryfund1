### P-7: EXTERNAL PLATFORM SYNC STANDARD (NEW — 2026-08-01)
Any campaign that exists on an external crowdfunding platform SHOULD be connected to the Interplanetary Fund for live sync:
- External platform connection recorded (platform_name, campaign_url, sync_method)
- Raised amount, goal amount, and donor count synced from external platform
- Last sync timestamp tracked
- Sync status tracked (success, error, pending)

- Available balance displayed as GROSS amount (pre-fee deduction)
- On cashout, display: "Available: $X | You will receive: $Y | Our fee: $Z"
- Platform fee: 5% (configurable)
- Processing fee: 2.9% + $0.30 (configurable)
- Fee calculated at PAYOUT time, not at deposit time
- Payout methods: CashApp ($Cashtag), Bitcoin (wallet address), PayPal (email)
- All payouts tracked with status (pending, processing, completed, failed)
- **Enforcement:** Treasury Agent manages holding accounts. Fee calculation handled by treasuryManager backend function (credit-free, tested and operational).
